# gitbcalc

Quick script I wrote for calculating how many more talent books you need to
farm, in lieu of the spreadsheet I made ages ago for myself to do this exact
thing but have unfortunately lost. Works for any number of talents.

## Usage

```pwsh
python -m venv .venv
./.venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1 # pwsh
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 talents.py <args...>
```
